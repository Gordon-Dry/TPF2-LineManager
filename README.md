# TPF2-LineManager
 A mod for Transport Fever 2 to automatically the manage number of vehicles on bus lines.
 Inspired by and uses functionality from https://github.com/IncredibleHannes/TPF2-Timetables
 

## Get started
 1. Create a bus line.
 2. Add one bus to the bus line.
 3. Make sure  depot is accessible for the buses on the bus line
 4. Make sure you have cash available for buying buses.

 The mode will add/remove i.e. buy/sell buses of the same type according to line utilization and demand.

## Future plans
 * None, expect making this stable and add some general coding improvements.
