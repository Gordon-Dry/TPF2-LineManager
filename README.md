# TPF2-LineManager
 A mod for Transport Fever 2 to automatically the manage number of vehicles on bus lines.
 GitHub repository is located here: https://github.com/TommyC81/TPF2-LineManager
 Inspired by and uses some functionality from https://github.com/IncredibleHannes/TPF2-Timetables
 
## Get started
 1. Create a bus line.
 2. Add one bus to the bus line.
 3. Make sure a depot is accessible for the buses on the bus line
 4. Make sure you have cash available for buying buses.

 The mode will add/remove i.e. buy/sell buses of the same type according to line utilization and demand.

## Future plans
 * None, except making this stable and add some general coding improvements.
