# TPF2-LineManager
 A mod to automatically manage number of vehicles on bus lines.
 Inspired by and uses functionality from https://github.com/IncredibleHannes/TPF2-Timetables
 

## Get started
 1. Create a bus line.
 2. Add one bus to the bus line.
 3. Make sure  depot is accessible for the buses on the bus line.

 The mode will add/remove i.e. buy/sell buses of the same type according to line utilization and demand.

## Future plans
 * None, expect making this stable and add some general coding improvements.
